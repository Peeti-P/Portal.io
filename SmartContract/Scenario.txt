Business Process
1.	Normal Route
  1.	Initiate Project [call function createProject(string _name, string memory _description, uint _goal, uint _minGoal)]
  2.	Participants Contribute money -> [Contribute(string _name) +  need to insert value]
      And receive ERC-20 token back
  3.	When money is already full -> [Initiators call Launch (transfer money from main to sub contract)]
  4.	Participants Vote for project [call vote (string _name)] participantsâ€™ ERC-20 token are burned 
  5.	Initiators call [(redeem(string _name, uint_minGoal)] to retrieve part of money and set new goal and ERC-20 token are re-minted back
  6.	 Repeat voting process and redeem
  7.	When the initiators want to retrieve final amount, they have to call redeem(string _name, uint_minGoal = 0)]
  8.	End
2.	Cancel Route
  1.	Initiate Project [call function createProject(string _name, string memory _description, uint _goal, uint _minGoal)]
